USAGE

- edit the first line of configure.ac
- replace all instances of "vala-skeleton" with your project's name
- rename and replace data/vala-skeleton.svg
- replace the Creative Commons 0 Public Domain Dedication in COPYING with a license appropriate for your project.

TIPS

# on Gentoo there is no 'valac' so we need to do something like this in order to build it manually:
VALAC=$(type -P valac-0.22) ./configure
make

# install in a local dir during development
mkdir ../usr
./configure --prefix="`realpath ../usr`"
make install
