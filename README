About

Vala project skeleton using autotools. Released under the Creative Commons 0 Public Domain Dedication so you can use it in free or commercial projects.

Usage

- copy and rename the 'vala-skeleton' subdirectory. Further instructions assume it as the working directory.
- edit the first line of configure.ac
- replace all instances of "vala-skeleton" with your project's name
- rename and replace data/vala-skeleton.svg
- put an appropriate license in COPYING

Tips

# on Gentoo there is no 'valac' so we need to do something like this in order to build it manually:
VALAC=$(type -P valac-0.22) ./configure
make

# install in a local dir during development
mkdir ../usr
./configure --prefix="`realpath ../usr`"
make install
